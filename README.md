9/8/2014 Week1 Facebook homework



Time spent: 5 hrs to finish all the required elements, spent an additional 1.5 hour trying to figure out showing/dismissing the keyboard but was not able to do it :/

Did all the requirement except the bonus below.

(Bonus
In the story detail view, tapping in the text field should bring up the keyboard and animate the text field above the keyboard.
Tapping the comment button from the home feed should push the story detail view and automatically select the text field.)
